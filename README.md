# Raster-based-Graphics-Pipeline-CPP

## Overview:
In this assignment, the task is to develop the raster based graphics pipeline used in OpenGL. The pipeline can
be thought of as a series of six stages. You will implement roughly 4 stages of the pipeline.
1. Stage 1: modeling transformation
2. Stage 2: view transformation
3. Stage 3: projection transformation
4. Stage 4: clipping & scan conversion using Z-buffer algorithm

The program will output five files: stage1.txt, stage2.txt, stage3.txt and
z-buffer.txt, out.bmp. The first three files will contain the output of the first three stages,
respectively. The fourth file will contain z-buffer values (only those which are less than the max value).
And the fifth file will be a bmp image generated by the pipeline.
Three will be two input files: scene.txt and config.txt
The first file will contain the scene description and second file will contain the necessary information for
the Z-buffer algorithm.
